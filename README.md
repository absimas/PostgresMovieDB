# About the work
The IMDB data was parsed using a manually written java program into working Postgres queries.
Once the Postgres DB was ready, the next was the UI to browse it.
The assignment required to be able to add, remove, update and search the database so a few optional
actions were implemented.
Although the assignment required a console program, I made a GUI. Since I wanted to make it quickly, 
I avoided adding too much abstraction into this project.
