# About the work
The IMDB data was converted into Postgres queries using a manually written java parser.
Once the Postgres DB was ready, the next step was the UI to browse it.
The assignment required to be able to add, remove, update and search the database so a few optional actions were implemented.
Although the requirement was a console program, I made a GUI. However, I wanted to make it quickly, so I avoided adding too much abstraction into this project.
